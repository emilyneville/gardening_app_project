        "Before Planting:": "Sprouts may be grown in a clean, wide-mouth glass canning jar, sprouting tray or a commercial sprouter.",
        "Planting:": "If sprouting in a glass jar, place the correct amount of seed in the glass jar. Cover the mouth of the jar with cheesecloth or other porous material, and secure with a rubber band. Fill the jar \u00bd full with lukewarm water and soak overnight. In the morning, drain off water. The cloth will keep the seeds in the jar. Rinse seeds with lukewarm water again and let drain. Put the container on its side in a dark location that stays about 60\u201370\u00b0F. At least twice each day, rinse with lukewarm water and drain. Continue rinse cycle until harvest.",
        "Watering:": "Sprouts don\u2019t require soil to grow, just water to germinate and a little bit of time before they are ready to consume.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization is not necessary.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Since sprouts are ready for consumption in as little as a week to two weeks.",
        "Harvesting:": "When sprouts have reached the desired length or have their first tiny green leaves, expose them to light for a few hours to color them up. Sprouts can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.",
        "Tips:": "Precautions should be taken when consuming sprouts as they are grown in warm, moist conditions which also is the prime growing environment for bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Sprouts are easily perishable, so refrigerate them and consume as quickly as possible. It is safest to cook the sprouts, as the heat will kill any bacteria growing there, and it is suggested that children, the elderly and anyone who is ill should not consume sprouts."

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Thin bunching onions to every 1\u2033 and bulb onions to every 4\u2033.\u00a0In short-season areas, for transplanting sow seeds indoors in flats in late February to mid-March. 2-3 seeds per cell and thin when 2\u2033 tall. Tops may be clipped to 5\u2033 tall. Transplant to the garden 1\u2033 apart for bunching and 4\u2033 apart for larger bulbs.",
        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

        "Before Planting:": "Garlic in most cases should be planted right before your first frost date in the fall. For more Southern states that are in zones 8-10, garlic should be planted in early December. Prepare garlic for planting by breaking apart all cloves from the garlic. Be careful to leave the outer skin attached. Soak cloves in a jar of water for 2 hours prior to planting. If you have some seaweed fertilizer laying around add some of this to the water. This will help prevent fungal disease.",

Cover with soil and add an organic fertilizer on top. Space cloves 4-6\u2033 apart in same row and rows 18-24\u2033 apart. For best results cover soil with 6-8\u2033 of straw. In a couple months you will see shoots poking through. During the winter months growth will stop. When spring arrives growth will resume.",
        "Watering:": "Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing.",

        "Days to Maturity:": "Garlic can take up to 210 days to mature.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest garlic when green leaves have turned brown and fallen over. Be sure to dig deep and under garlic to not break or cut the garlic itself. Upon harvesting garlic will store best with leaves braided and hung in a dark, cool cellar.",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes.

        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix aged manure and compost into the soil. Melons are heavy feeders, so fertilize at planting and throughout the growing season with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. Do not let the granules come in contact with the plant.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Planting:": "Squash grow well in mounds, so hill up some soil and plant three to five seeds per mound. Plant seeds 1 inch deep in mounds set 4 feet apart after all danger of frost has passed. Squash can be started indoors three to four weeks before the last frost date. Squash also grow well in pots or buckets, 5 to 10 gallons is large enough. Row covers should be removed when plants begin to flower.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch a week. Mulching can also help retain moisture.",
        "Fertilizer:": "To encourage squash growth, it is important to fertilize prior to planting the seeds and during its growing",

For more Southern states that are in zones 8-10, garlic should be planted in early December. Prepare garlic for planting by breaking apart all cloves from the garlic. Be careful to leave the outer skin attached. Soak cloves in a jar of water for 2 hours prior to planting. If you have some seaweed fertilizer laying around add some of this to the water. This will help prevent fungal disease.",

Cover with soil and add an organic fertilizer on top. Space cloves 4-6\u2033 apart in same row and rows 18-24\u2033 apart. For best results cover soil with 6-8\u2033 of straw. In a couple months you will see shoots poking through. During the winter months growth will stop. When spring arrives growth will resume.",
        "Watering:": "Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Garlic requires adequate\u00a0nitrogen, so fertilize accordingly. Blood meal\u00a0is a good source of high-nitrogen fertilizer.\u00a0Once you begin fertilization, fertilize the\u00a0garlic every three weeks.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Garlic can take up to 210 days to mature.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest garlic when green leaves have turned brown and fallen over. Be sure to dig deep and under garlic to not break or cut the garlic itself. Upon harvesting garlic will store best with leaves braided and hung in a dark, cool cellar.",
        "Tips:": "Garlic repels pests from the garden, so it\u00a0doesn\u2019t have much trouble with them."

Only treated seeds of good cold-germinating varieties may be sown in 55\u00b0F soil if warmer weather is anticipated. We recommend planting UNTREATED seeds when soil is warm, at least 65\u00b0F. Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk. Corn is ready to eat 18-24 days after ear silks first show; the warmer the weather, the sooner you can pick it.",

For a Fall crop, start seedlings indoors 3-4 weeks before transplanting. as above in May and transplant to the garden in June\u2013July. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in the Fall. Successful broccoli crops can be grown where winters are rarely below 32\u00b0F. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions. Sow 3\u20134 seeds 12\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 18\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",

Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy.

        "Planting:": "Shoots should be between 4 and 8 inches tall before they\u2019re transplanted outside. When the shoots are old enough, transplant them outside. Since sweet potatoes like it warm, plant the transplants in raised rows, which are usually about 8 inches higher than ground level.",
        "Watering:": "Water your sweet potato plants weekly since a regular watering schedule will help prevent the sweet potato skin from splitting.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add fertilizer containing potassium approximately two weeks after planting the slips.",

        "Harvesting:": "The tubers will grow close to the surface, so dig gently when harvesting. If harvesting too roughly, the sweet potato skin will bruise.",
        "Tips:": "To avoid vines over growing , gently weed the vines two weeks after you\u2019ve planted the slips. Avoid using a hoe so you don\u2019t disrupt the feeder roots."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",

Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside.

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Watering:": "Water every other day so that the soils is moist, but not over watered.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

        "Planting:": "Cold soil planting risks poor germination. Even treated corn seeds risk low germination under 60\u00b0F. Only treated seeds of good cold-germinating varieties may be sown in 55\u00b0F soil if warmer weather is anticipated. We recommend planting UNTREATED seeds when soil is warm, at least 65\u00b0F. Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk. Corn is ready to eat 18-24 days after ear silks first show; the warmer the weather, the sooner you can pick it.",

If pea is a vining variety its best to have a support or trellis system to help with diseases and yield. For fall crops sow 6-8 weeks before first frost date. Inoculate peas to encourage formation of nitrogen producing nodules on the plant roots. This enriches the soil, results in larger plants, and increases yield.",
        "Watering:": "Always keep seeds well watered during germination and then water the plant sparingly. Don\u2019t hoe the area as this may damage roots.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Too much fertilization may harm peas, as they are vulnerable to nitrogen. Compost may help, though pea plants don\u2019t need much fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Peas can typically be harvested between 12 and 15 weeks after planting. Rotate pea crop every other year. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest snow peas right at the beginning of seed formation and sugar peas when seeds are full size. Harvest frequently to increase yields. Do not let peas over-mature as this will slow production.",
        "Tips:": "Peas are a cool weather crop best grown in spring and fall. For best yields ensure adequate fertility, pH of 6.0-7.5 and well draining soil."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Only treated seeds of good cold-germinating varieties may be sown in 55\u00b0F soil if warmer weather is anticipated. We recommend planting UNTREATED seeds when soil is warm, at least 65\u00b0F. Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk.

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions.

        "Planting:": "If sprouting in a glass jar, place the correct amount of seed in the glass jar. Cover the mouth of the jar with cheesecloth or other porous material, and secure with a rubber band. Fill the jar \u00bd full with lukewarm water and soak overnight. In the morning, drain off water. The cloth will keep the seeds in the jar. Rinse seeds with lukewarm water again and let drain. Put the container on its side in a dark location that stays about 60\u201370\u00b0F. At least twice each day, rinse with lukewarm water and drain. Continue rinse cycle until harvest.",
        "Watering:": "Sprouts don\u2019t require soil to grow, just water to germinate and a little bit of time before they are ready to consume.",

        "Days to Maturity:": "Since sprouts are ready for consumption in as little as a week to two weeks.",
        "Harvesting:": "When sprouts have reached the desired length or have their first tiny green leaves, expose them to light for a few hours to color them up. Sprouts can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.",
        "Tips:": "Precautions should be taken when consuming sprouts as they are grown in warm, moist conditions which also is the prime growing environment for bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Sprouts are easily perishable, so refrigerate them and consume as quickly as possible. It is safest to cook the sprouts, as the heat will kill any bacteria growing there, and it is suggested that children, the elderly and anyone who is ill should not consume sprouts."

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",

Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Before Planting:": "It is not recommended to start corn seeds indoors.",
        "Planting:": "Cold soil planting risks poor germination. Even treated corn seeds risk low germination under 60\u00b0F. Only treated seeds of good cold-germinating varieties may be sown in 55\u00b0F soil if warmer weather is anticipated. We recommend planting UNTREATED seeds when soil is warm, at least 65\u00b0F. Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk. Corn is ready to eat 18-24 days after ear silks first show; the warmer the weather, the sooner you can pick it.",
        "Tips:": "Weed carefully to not damage the roots. Water retention may be done by mulching the corn plants."

        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes.

        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Sow seeds outdoors after last frost is expect and soil temperatures are above 70\u00b0F. Triploid (Seedless) watermelon varieties need to be grown with Diploid (Seed) watermelon varieties for fertilization. Sugar Baby is good selection for a diploid fertilizer.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, sow 1\u20132 weeks after last frost when soil is warm, above 70\u00b0F, 3 seeds every 18\u201336\u2033, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per location when seedlings have first true leaves. If transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds, 1\u2033 deep in a 2\u2033 peat pot 2-4 weeks before last frost date (no sooner!). Germinate at 80\u00b0F then reduce to a constant 75\u00b0F). Keep well watered until 1 week before placing outdoors. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. Transplant 2\u20133\u2032 apart in rows 6\u20138\u2032 apart. Even hardened watermelon seedlings are tender! Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "When they are younger, watermelon plants require lots up water, up to 2 inches per week. If your able try not to water the fruits 1 week before harvest as over-watering can cause bland fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, amend soil with compost and a higher nitrogen fertilizer. Once vines begin to ramble, side dress plants with a 5-10-5 fertilizer and again once the melons are set.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "There are 2 good ways to tell when a watermelon is ripe: 1) the tendril nearest the point on the vine where fruit stem attaches is browning/dead. 2) the spot where the fruit rests on the ground is pale yellow. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Once a watermelon is picked, it doesn\u2019t ripen any further. To harvest, take a knife and cut",
        "Tips:": "Pruning the plant is not necessary, but it may direct more energy to growing the fruits. If you choose to prune,",

Wait for true leaves and leave best looking seedling per cell. Seedlings should be ready to transplant in 4\u20135 weeks. Do not wait too long to plant seedlings outdoors. 5 weeks is the oldest the transplants should be to avoid stressing the plant. Harden plants carefully by gradually increasing cold before transplanting out, 18\u2033 between plants and 24\u201336\u2033 between rows. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall growing. Start seedlings as above in late spring and transplant to the garden in Summer. Sow 2-3 seeds 18\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 24\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",
        "Watering:": "Cauliflower requires consistent soil moisture. Water 1 to 1.5 inches each week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting cauliflower seeds, add compost to the soil. This prevents \u201cbuttoning,\u201d which is when a cauliflower produces smaller, button-shaped heads rather than a large, full head. For best growth, use a nitrogen-high fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "The plant should be ready to harvest about a week or two after blanching. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest heads when desired size is obtained but before the curds becomes loose and bitter. Store at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity for 2\u20133 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "When small white curds begin to develop, gather up exterior leaves and wrap around heads and tie with a rubber band, this is called blanching. Blanching will help protect heads from direct sunlight and keep curds white rather than turning pale yellow with direct sunlight."

Plant about 10 seeds/ft, 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 1\u2032 apart. Radishes are adversely affected by hot, dry weather. They remain in prime condition only a few days and should be grown rapidly with plenty of moisture to be mild, tender, and attractive.",
        "Watering:": "Water every other day so that the soils is moist, but not over watered.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",
        "Tips:": "When planted near cucumbers, peppers and squash, radishes can draw aphids away from the other plants."

For a continuous supply of greens and small tender beets, sow seed at 2-week intervals until 8 weeks before regular heavy frosts are expected. Sow seeds 4-6 weeks before transplanting out after heavy frosts have decreased. Sow seeds 1/2\u2033 deep, 2-3 seeds per cell. Transplant out 3\u2033 apart in rows 14-18\u2033 apart.",
        "Watering:": "Since beets consist of mostly water, the plant requires adequate watering to grow. Water beets at least an inch weekly if rain doesn\u2019t supply enough moisture. Water slowly to permeate the soil and reach the root.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Apply some high-nitrogen fertilizer six weeks after planting.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "14-21 days to have transplant ready, then see days to maturity for each variety.",
        "Harvesting:": "Sow about 10 weeks before heavy freeze is expected. Dig under beet root and lift plants tops, wash, and store 6 months at 32\u00b0F and high humidity. Wash and put in cool location. Store cool and high humidity for best results.",
        "Tips:": "Though beets can grow in partial shade, their roots may run into tree roots, so plant in deep soil."

Sprouts are easily perishable, so refrigerate them and consume as quickly as possible. It is safest to cook the sprouts, as the heat will kill any bacteria growing there, and it is suggested that children, the elderly and anyone who is ill should not consume sprouts."

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes.

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",

To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Harden plants carefully by gradually increasing cold before transplanting out, 18\u2033 between plants and 24\u201336\u2033 between rows. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall growing. Start seedlings as above in late spring and transplant to the garden in Summer. Sow 2-3 seeds 18\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 24\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",

Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",
        "Tips:": "When planted near cucumbers, peppers and squash, radishes can draw aphids away from the other plants."

        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting.

After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Planting:": "Radishes require well drained soils with a pH range of 6-7.0. Direct sow at any time during the season, beginning in early spring into early fall. Plant about 10 seeds/ft, 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 1\u2032 apart. Radishes are adversely affected by hot, dry weather. They remain in prime condition only a few days and should be grown rapidly with plenty of moisture to be mild, tender, and attractive.",
        "Watering:": "Water every other day so that the soils is moist, but not over watered.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

        "Planting:": "Start seeds indoors under controlled conditions. Use soilless grow media. Place in a sunny window with at least 8 hours of sunlight. Water only when soil feels dry to touch. No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day.

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Only treated seeds of good cold-germinating varieties may be sown in 55\u00b0F soil if warmer weather is anticipated. We recommend planting UNTREATED seeds when soil is warm, at least 65\u00b0F. Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk. Corn is ready to eat 18-24 days after ear silks first show; the warmer the weather, the sooner you can pick it.",

        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Planting:": "Start seeds indoors under controlled conditions. Use soilless grow media. Place in a sunny window with at least 8 hours of sunlight. Water only when soil feels dry to touch. No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Before Planting:": "A light, well-drained soil with a pH of 7.0 and a southern exposure is ideal. Good soil moisture is important in early stages of growth and during pollination when fruits are setting.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, sow 1-2 weeks after last frost when soil is warm, above 70\u00b0F, 3 seeds every 18\u2033, 1/2\u2033 deep, thinning to 1 plant/spot. Space rows 6\u2032 apart. For transplanting, sow indoors in 3 weeks before last frost and transplanting outside. Plant 2-3 seeds per or pot, about 1/4\u2033 deep. Keep temperature 80-90\u00b0F until germination. Handle young plants carefully and never let the soil dry out. Grow seedlings at 75\u00b0F. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. When the weather is frost-free, warm, and settled, transplant 2-3\u2032 apart in rows 6\u2032 apart or thin to 1 plant/pot or cell with scissors and transplant 18\u2033 apart. Even hardened melon seedlings are tender. Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "Melons need a steady supply of water, and soil needs to be damped but not flooded, approximately 1 inch a week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix aged manure and compost into the soil. Melons are heavy feeders, so fertilize at planting and throughout the growing season with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. Do not let the granules come in contact with the plant.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",
        "Tips:": "Cut off watering 1 week before harvest. This will give a more flavorful, concentrated melon. Over watering before harvest can cause bland taste.",

        "Watering:": "Water 1 inch per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix a 10-10-10 fertilizer in with the soil. Once okra reaches 6 inches tall, give a side-dressing of fertilizer. Side-dress again two to three weeks later. Reapply the fertilizer every four to six weeks throughout its growing season.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Okra is ready two months after planting. Pods should be approximately 3 inches long when harvested. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly by clipping pods at 3-4\u2033 long to keep plants productive. Oversized pods become tough and decrease overall yield of plant.",

Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",

        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",

Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",

To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside.

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Give more sunlight and wind conditions slowly over 7-10 days until ready for outdoor conditions. Do not expose to weather below\u00a050\u00b0F.Transplant 10-12 week seedlings outdoors when weather is warm and settled (late spring). Set plants 6\u20138\u2033 apart in rows 24\u201336\u2033 apart. Irrigate to keep soil moist.",
        "Watering:": "Make sure celery is planted in the lowest area of the garden, as it requires lots of water.Do not let the soil dry out, indoors or out. Celery needs constant supply of water to give best flavor and yield.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Celery requires a fertile soil with a pH range of 6.0\u20137.0. Add compost and mulch around the",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Celery can take up to 140 days before it is ready to harvest.",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut stalks when desired size. Stalks may be blanched if desired by hilling up with soil or by placing paper collars around plants. Harvest in morning when heat is at a minimum. May be dunked in cold water to bring temperature down if harvested in warm temperatures. Store roots at 32\u00b0F with 98\u2013100% relative humidity. Celery will store for 1\u20132 months. We suggest blanching for best eating quality celery.",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

More leaves will grow in their place. If harvesting the whole plant, gently dig the turnip from the ground. If harvesting for both the root and the leaves, the turnip should be about 2 inches in diameter, but if the leaves have been harvested first, the turnip should be 3 inches in diameter when it is ready to be pulled. Pick turnips when they are smaller for a milder, sweeter flavor. Turnips with greens store at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity for 10-14 days.",

        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix aged manure and compost into the soil. Melons are heavy feeders, so fertilize at planting and throughout the growing season with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. Do not let the granules come in contact with the plant.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy.

        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

If pea is a vining variety its best to have a support or trellis system to help with diseases and yield. For fall crops sow 6-8 weeks before first frost date. Inoculate peas to encourage formation of nitrogen producing nodules on the plant roots. This enriches the soil, results in larger plants, and increases yield.",
        "Watering:": "Always keep seeds well watered during germination and then water the plant sparingly. Don\u2019t hoe the area as this may damage roots.",

        "Harvesting:": "Harvest snow peas right at the beginning of seed formation and sugar peas when seeds are full size. Harvest frequently to increase yields. Do not let peas over-mature as this will slow production.",
        "Tips:": "Peas are a cool weather crop best grown in spring and fall. For best yields ensure adequate fertility, pH of 6.0-7.5 and well draining soil."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

        "Planting:": "Use early and midseason varieties for Spring growing. Sow 2 seeds \u00bd\u201d depth in each cell. Germinate at 70\u00b0F and then grow at 60\u00b0F thereafter. Wait for true leaves and leave best looking seedling per cell. Seedlings should be ready to transplant in 4\u20135 weeks. Do not wait too long to plant seedlings outdoors. 5 weeks is the oldest the transplants should be to avoid stressing the plant. Harden plants carefully by gradually increasing cold before transplanting out, 18\u2033 between plants and 24\u201336\u2033 between rows. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall growing. Start seedlings as above in late spring and transplant to the garden in Summer. Sow 2-3 seeds 18\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 24\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",

        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting cauliflower seeds, add compost to the soil. This prevents \u201cbuttoning,\u201d which is when a cauliflower produces smaller, button-shaped heads rather than a large, full head. For best growth, use a nitrogen-high fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "The plant should be ready to harvest about a week or two after blanching. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest heads when desired size is obtained but before the curds becomes loose and bitter. Store at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity for 2\u20133 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "When small white curds begin to develop, gather up exterior leaves and wrap around heads and tie with a rubber band, this is called blanching. Blanching will help protect heads from direct sunlight and keep curds white rather than turning pale yellow with direct sunlight."

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Keep soil uniformly moist during germination and early growing. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds in cells, barely covering seeds with fine vermiculite, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Shade the flats on sunny, warm days if necessary to keep the soil surface cool, below 70\u00b0F, until germination. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 4-5 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant 8\u2033 apart in rows 18\u2033 apart. Transplant shallowly so that the base of the plant will be slightly above the soil to discourage bottom rot. For salad mix/baby leaf, sow 3-4 seeds per inch. Cover seeds lightly, about 1/8\u2033, tap soil down gently and keep surface moist until emergence (3-10 days). Harvest at 5-6 weeks.",

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart.

        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

For a Fall crop, start seedlings indoors 3-4 weeks before transplanting. as above in May and transplant to the garden in June\u2013July. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in the Fall. Successful broccoli crops can be grown where winters are rarely below 32\u00b0F.

After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",

Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

For a Fall crop, start seedlings indoors 3-4 weeks before transplanting. as above in May and transplant to the garden in June\u2013July. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in the Fall. Successful broccoli crops can be grown where winters are rarely below 32\u00b0F. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions. Sow 3\u20134 seeds 12\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 18\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",

        "Planting:": "If sprouting in a glass jar, place the correct amount of seed in the glass jar. Cover the mouth of the jar with cheesecloth or other porous material, and secure with a rubber band. Fill the jar \u00bd full with lukewarm water and soak overnight. In the morning, drain off water. The cloth will keep the seeds in the jar. Rinse seeds with lukewarm water again and let drain. Put the container on its side in a dark location that stays about 60\u201370\u00b0F. At least twice each day, rinse with lukewarm water and drain. Continue rinse cycle until harvest.",
        "Watering:": "Sprouts don\u2019t require soil to grow, just water to germinate and a little bit of time before they are ready to consume.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization is not necessary.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Since sprouts are ready for consumption in as little as a week to two weeks.",
        "Harvesting:": "When sprouts have reached the desired length or have their first tiny green leaves, expose them to light for a few hours to color them up. Sprouts can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.",
        "Tips:": "Precautions should be taken when consuming sprouts as they are grown in warm, moist conditions which also is the prime growing environment for bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Sprouts are easily perishable, so refrigerate them and consume as quickly as possible. It is safest to cook the sprouts, as the heat will kill any bacteria growing there, and it is suggested that children, the elderly and anyone who is ill should not consume sprouts."

        "Before Planting:": "Tomatoes should be grown in a sunny location with good soil drainage.",
        "Planting:": "Start seeds indoors under controlled conditions. Use soilless grow media. Place in a sunny window with at least 8 hours of sunlight. Water only when soil feels dry to touch. No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Harvesting:": "When sprouts have reached the desired length or have their first tiny green leaves, expose them to light for a few hours to color them up. Sprouts can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week.",
        "Tips:": "Precautions should be taken when consuming sprouts as they are grown in warm, moist conditions which also is the prime growing environment for bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Sprouts are easily perishable, so refrigerate them and consume as quickly as possible. It is safest to cook the sprouts, as the heat will kill any bacteria growing there, and it is suggested that children, the elderly and anyone who is ill should not consume sprouts."

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day.

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can include blood meal, cottonseed, composted manure or liquid\u00a0fertilizer, though spinach is a quick grower and gardeners may want to only revert to fertilization if their spinach is experiencing slow growth.

        "Days to Maturity:": "Leaves are ready once they are large enough to eat according to each individual gardener\u2019s taste. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For baby leaves,\u00a0Clip small leaves in 3-5 weeks, depending on time of year and speed of growth. Harvest spinach full size but before bolting, cutting just below root attachment for \u201crooted spinach\u201d, or cut higher for \u201cclipped spinach\u201d.",
        "Tips:": "It is also possible to cut the plant about two inches above the soil when it begins to bolt and it may produce again. In colder climates, gardeners can cover their crop with hay, and it may sprout again in early spring."

Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk. Corn is ready to eat 18-24 days after ear silks first show; the warmer the weather, the sooner you can pick it.",
        "Tips:": "Weed carefully to not damage the roots. Water retention may be done by mulching the corn plants."

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture.

Space rows 6\u2032 apart. For transplanting, sow indoors in 3 weeks before last frost and transplanting outside. Plant 2-3 seeds per or pot, about 1/4\u2033 deep. Keep temperature 80-90\u00b0F until germination. Handle young plants carefully and never let the soil dry out. Grow seedlings at 75\u00b0F. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. When the weather is frost-free, warm, and settled, transplant 2-3\u2032 apart in rows 6\u2032 apart or thin to 1 plant/pot or cell with scissors and transplant 18\u2033 apart.

        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk. Corn is ready to eat 18-24 days after ear silks first show; the warmer the weather, the sooner you can pick it.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties.

        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day.

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions.

Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Fertilizer:": "Cowpeas grow quicker if fertilizer is applied immediately after planting. Once the plants are established, they generally do not require frequent fertilization. However, if the plant\u2019s green leaves become pale, this means they are experiencing a nitrogen deficiency. They can then be fertilized with fish emulsion or nitrogen-rich fertilizers.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Cowpeas take 80 days or more to become ready for harvest. If growing on a vine, they will need some support like a pole or fence during their growth.",
        "Harvesting:": "Cowpea pods can get up to 6 to 10 inches in length and look similar to green beans. Pods can be harvested when they\u2019re young, as well as when they\u2019ve dried. If harvesting while green, pick the pods when they are very young. To harvest dry cowpea pods, pick after the pods have dried on the vine.",
        "Tips:": "Do not plant cowpea seeds in the same spot in the garden more than once every four years. Cowpeas grow well near corn, strawberries and cucumbers, but do not plant them near fennel or onions."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day.

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

If sowing has to be done during warmer weather, irrigating can help cool the soil and improve germination. Sow in mid to late summer for a fall harvest. Spinach can also be planted from late summer until freeze-up in protected structures for fall, winter, and spring harvest. Using floating row covers offers additional winter protection. For baby leaf: Sow in a 1/2\u2033 apart, 2-3\u2033 bands, 1/2\u2033 deep, about 40 seeds/ft.For a continuous supply, sow every 7 days. For bunching and full size: Sow 10 seeds/ft., 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 12-18\u2033 apart.",
        "Watering:": "Water regularly, and keep soil moist with mulch.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can include blood meal, cottonseed, composted manure or liquid\u00a0fertilizer, though spinach is a quick grower and gardeners may want to only revert to fertilization if their spinach is experiencing slow growth. Radishes planted nearby spinach will attract leaf miners away from spinach leaves. The leaf miners don\u2019t harm the underground radish.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Leaves are ready once they are large enough to eat according to each individual gardener\u2019s taste. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For baby leaves,\u00a0Clip small leaves in 3-5 weeks, depending on time of year and speed of growth. Harvest spinach full size but before bolting, cutting just below root attachment for \u201crooted spinach\u201d, or cut higher for \u201cclipped spinach\u201d.",

Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Sprouts are ready when their buds are green and about one to two inches in diameter. Seed individual varieties for specific maturity. (100 days)",
        "Harvesting:": "After frost and until severe cold sprouts can be harvested. Pick when sprouts are firm and well formed, starting at the bottom of the stem. Break off the leaf below the sprout and snap off the sprout. The upper sprouts will continue to form and enlarge as the lower ones are harvested.",
        "Tips:": "Before ground freezes, pull plants out by the roots and place in a cool cellar. Can be stored for 4-6 weeks this way."

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Spinach can also be planted from late summer until freeze-up in protected structures for fall, winter, and spring harvest. Using floating row covers offers additional winter protection. For baby leaf: Sow in a 1/2\u2033 apart, 2-3\u2033 bands, 1/2\u2033 deep, about 40 seeds/ft.For a continuous supply, sow every 7 days.

Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

For more Southern states that are in zones 8-10, garlic should be planted in early December. Prepare garlic for planting by breaking apart all cloves from the garlic. Be careful to leave the outer skin attached. Soak cloves in a jar of water for 2 hours prior to planting. If you have some seaweed fertilizer laying around add some of this to the water. This will help prevent fungal disease.",
        "Planting:": "Plant garlic in a rich, well drained soil that is weed-free. Dig a hole 2\u2033 deep and place soaked garlic clove in hole with the flat end facing down (pointy end up). Cover with soil and add an organic fertilizer on top. Space cloves 4-6\u2033 apart in same row and rows 18-24\u2033 apart. For best results cover soil with 6-8\u2033 of straw. In a couple months you will see shoots poking through. During the winter months growth will stop. When spring arrives growth will resume.",
        "Watering:": "Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Garlic requires adequate\u00a0nitrogen, so fertilize accordingly. Blood meal\u00a0is a good source of high-nitrogen fertilizer.\u00a0Once you begin fertilization, fertilize the\u00a0garlic every three weeks.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Garlic can take up to 210 days to mature.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest garlic when green leaves have turned brown and fallen over. Be sure to dig deep and under garlic to not break or cut the garlic itself. Upon harvesting garlic will store best with leaves braided and hung in a dark, cool cellar.",
        "Tips:": "Garlic repels pests from the garden, so it\u00a0doesn\u2019t have much trouble with them."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Once he got a stable variety, he offered it to the public saying that \"one tomato could feed a family of 4.\" Gardeners drove from far away places just to get their hands on this variety! He sold each plant for $1 each and was able to pay off his $6,000 mortgage on his house, hence giving this tomato its name.

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

In a couple months you will see shoots poking through. During the winter months growth will stop. When spring arrives growth will resume.",
        "Watering:": "Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Garlic requires adequate\u00a0nitrogen, so fertilize accordingly. Blood meal\u00a0is a good source of high-nitrogen fertilizer.\u00a0Once you begin fertilization, fertilize the\u00a0garlic every three weeks.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Garlic can take up to 210 days to mature.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest garlic when green leaves have turned brown and fallen over. Be sure to dig deep and under garlic to not break or cut the garlic itself. Upon harvesting garlic will store best with leaves braided and hung in a dark, cool cellar.",

        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",

Thin bunching onions to every 1\u2033 and bulb onions to every 4\u2033.\u00a0In short-season areas, for transplanting sow seeds indoors in flats in late February to mid-March. 2-3 seeds per cell and thin when 2\u2033 tall. Tops may be clipped to 5\u2033 tall. Transplant to the garden 1\u2033 apart for bunching and 4\u2033 apart for larger bulbs.",
        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk.

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Planting:": "Start seeds indoors under controlled conditions. Use soilless grow media. Place in a sunny window with at least 8 hours of sunlight. Water only when soil feels dry to touch. No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk.

        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",

        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Before Planting:": "Garlic in most cases should be planted right before your first frost date in the fall. For more Southern states that are in zones 8-10, garlic should be planted in early December. Prepare garlic for planting by breaking apart all cloves from the garlic. Be careful to leave the outer skin attached. Soak cloves in a jar of water for 2 hours prior to planting. If you have some seaweed fertilizer laying around add some of this to the water. This will help prevent fungal disease.",
        "Planting:": "Plant garlic in a rich, well drained soil that is weed-free. Dig a hole 2\u2033 deep and place soaked garlic clove in hole with the flat end facing down (pointy end up). Cover with soil and add an organic fertilizer on top. Space cloves 4-6\u2033 apart in same row and rows 18-24\u2033 apart. For best results cover soil with 6-8\u2033 of straw. In a couple months you will see shoots poking through. During the winter months growth will stop. When spring arrives growth will resume.",
        "Watering:": "Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Garlic requires adequate\u00a0nitrogen, so fertilize accordingly. Blood meal\u00a0is a good source of high-nitrogen fertilizer.\u00a0Once you begin fertilization, fertilize the\u00a0garlic every three weeks.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Garlic can take up to 210 days to mature.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest garlic when green leaves have turned brown and fallen over. Be sure to dig deep and under garlic to not break or cut the garlic itself. Upon harvesting garlic will store best with leaves braided and hung in a dark, cool cellar.",
        "Tips:": "Garlic repels pests from the garden, so it\u00a0doesn\u2019t have much trouble with them."

        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",

        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Plant about 10 seeds/ft, 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 1\u2032 apart. Radishes are adversely affected by hot, dry weather. They remain in prime condition only a few days and should be grown rapidly with plenty of moisture to be mild, tender, and attractive.",
        "Watering:": "Water every other day so that the soils is moist, but not over watered.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",

        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

        "Harvesting:": "Cowpea pods can get up to 6 to 10 inches in length and look similar to green beans. Pods can be harvested when they\u2019re young, as well as when they\u2019ve dried. If harvesting while green, pick the pods when they are very young. To harvest dry cowpea pods, pick after the pods have dried on the vine.",
        "Tips:": "Do not plant cowpea seeds in the same spot in the garden more than once every four years. Cowpeas grow well near corn, strawberries and cucumbers, but do not plant them near fennel or onions."

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Planting:": "Begin sowing in early spring as soon as the ground can be worked. Summer sowing with higher soil temperatures will lead to low germination. Do not use a heat mat to germinate. If sowing has to be done during warmer weather, irrigating can help cool the soil and improve germination. Sow in mid to late summer for a fall harvest. Spinach can also be planted from late summer until freeze-up in protected structures for fall, winter, and spring harvest. Using floating row covers offers additional winter protection. For baby leaf: Sow in a 1/2\u2033 apart, 2-3\u2033 bands, 1/2\u2033 deep, about 40 seeds/ft.For a continuous supply, sow every 7 days. For bunching and full size: Sow 10 seeds/ft., 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 12-18\u2033 apart.",

        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can include blood meal, cottonseed, composted manure or liquid\u00a0fertilizer, though spinach is a quick grower and gardeners may want to only revert to fertilization if their spinach is experiencing slow growth. Radishes planted nearby spinach will attract leaf miners away from spinach leaves. The leaf miners don\u2019t harm the underground radish.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Leaves are ready once they are large enough to eat according to each individual gardener\u2019s taste. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For baby leaves,\u00a0Clip small leaves in 3-5 weeks, depending on time of year and speed of growth. Harvest spinach full size but before bolting, cutting just below root attachment for \u201crooted spinach\u201d, or cut higher for \u201cclipped spinach\u201d.",
        "Tips:": "It is also possible to cut the plant about two inches above the soil when it begins to bolt and it may produce again. In colder climates, gardeners can cover their crop with hay, and it may sprout again in early spring."

Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",
        "Tips:": "Cut off watering 1 week before harvest. This will give a more flavorful, concentrated melon. Over watering before harvest can cause bland taste.",

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north.

        "Watering:": "Water every other day so that the soils is moist, but not over watered.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Since radishes grow so fast, they don\u2019t need fertilized during their growth but can benefit from soil that is fertilized prior to planting the seeds. Before planting, spread a 2-inch layer of compost over the furrows where the radish seeds will grow. Sprinkle \u00bd pound of 16-20-0 fertilizer per 50 square feet of radishes. Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate. Radishes will keep 3-4 weeks in good, crisp condition if kept at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity.",

        "Days to Maturity:": "Turnips are ready to harvest 40 to 55 days after planting. If harvesting the leaves, they are ready when they reach 4-6 inches in height.",
        "Harvesting:": "If only harvesting the leaves, cut them from the plant when they reach the desired size, leaving 1 inch of leaves above the crown of the plant. More leaves will grow in their place. If harvesting the whole plant, gently dig the turnip from the ground. If harvesting for both the root and the leaves, the turnip should be about 2 inches in diameter, but if the leaves have been harvested first, the turnip should be 3 inches in diameter when it is ready to be pulled. Pick turnips when they are smaller for a milder, sweeter flavor. Turnips with greens store at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity for 10-14 days.",

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions. Sow 3-4 seeds 12\u2033 apart, 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 24-36\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",

        "Days to Maturity:": "See each variety for maturity rate from transplanting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Relatively young heads (still green and actively growing) store best. Ideal conditions are 32\u00b0F at 95% relative humidity, with good air circulation.",
        "Tips:": "Cabbage plants do better when planted near herbs like dill and rosemary. Avoid planting cabbage near strawberries, tomatoes or pole beans."

        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions. Sow 3-4 seeds 12\u2033 apart, 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 24-36\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",

Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions.

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds will germinate from 45\u201385\u00b0F with highest germination at 75\u00b0F, depending on the variety and seed lot. Sow seeds 1\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and tap soil down gently. Thin to 8\u2033 apart. Keep soil uniformly moist during germination and early growing. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds in cells, barely covering seeds with fine vermiculite, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Shade the flats on sunny, warm days if necessary to keep the soil surface cool, below 70\u00b0F, until germination. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 4-5 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant 8\u2033 apart in rows 18\u2033 apart. Transplant shallowly so that the base of the plant will be slightly above the soil to discourage bottom rot. For salad mix/baby leaf, sow 3-4 seeds per inch. Cover seeds lightly, about 1/8\u2033, tap soil down gently and keep surface moist until emergence (3-10 days). Harvest at 5-6 weeks.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

For a Fall crop, start seedlings indoors 3-4 weeks before transplanting. as above in May and transplant to the garden in June\u2013July. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in the Fall. Successful broccoli crops can be grown where winters are rarely below 32\u00b0F. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions. Sow 3\u20134 seeds 12\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 18\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",
        "Watering:": "Broccoli likes cool soil, so adding grass clippings around the plants helps. Also, water deeply and often. When watering broccoli, do not get water on the developing heads. Some varieties of broccoli are heat tolerant, but still require adequate watering, such as 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Broccoli is ready to harvest when florets are tightly closed in the center but begin to loosen slightly around the edges. (50-80 days)",
        "Harvesting:": "Before flower buds open, cut center head. Harvest secondary side shoots regularly to encourage continued production. If buds begin to show a yellow color, harvest immediately.",
        "Tips:": "Repel flea beetles and root maggots on young seedlings by covering with floating row covers from day of planting. Treat flea beetles with pyrethrin or azadirachtin if heavy pressure is observed. For cabbage worms and loopers, use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt.)."

Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",

Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

This highly productive, open pollinated heirloom tomato is one of the earlier maturing tomato varieties and has been around since 1934. Rutgers grows on a strong vine and can weigh anywhere from 6-12 ounces. The first maturing tomatoes tend to be smaller while later maturing tomatoes are larger. This tomato has a beautiful flesh inside with a good ratio of flesh to gel with a few seeds for each slice. This variety holds well when sliced making it great for sandwiches! The Rutgers tomatoes were originally developed by a Rutgers University scientist named Lyman G. Schermerhorn in co-operation with the Campbell's Soup Company. The tomato was developed by crossing Marglobe with a variety called JTD. As time went on, the Rutgers became the most famous tomato worldwide and once made up over 70% of the tomatoes being processed in the United States.",

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north.

        "Before Planting:": "A light, well-drained soil with a pH of 7.0 and a southern exposure is ideal. Good soil moisture is important in early stages of growth and during pollination when fruits are setting.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, sow 1-2 weeks after last frost when soil is warm, above 70\u00b0F, 3 seeds every 18\u2033, 1/2\u2033 deep, thinning to 1 plant/spot. Space rows 6\u2032 apart. For transplanting, sow indoors in 3 weeks before last frost and transplanting outside. Plant 2-3 seeds per or pot, about 1/4\u2033 deep. Keep temperature 80-90\u00b0F until germination. Handle young plants carefully and never let the soil dry out. Grow seedlings at 75\u00b0F. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. When the weather is frost-free, warm, and settled, transplant 2-3\u2032 apart in rows 6\u2032 apart or thin to 1 plant/pot or cell with scissors and transplant 18\u2033 apart. Even hardened melon seedlings are tender. Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "Melons need a steady supply of water, and soil needs to be damped but not flooded, approximately 1 inch a week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix aged manure and compost into the soil. Melons are heavy feeders, so fertilize at planting and throughout the growing season with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. Do not let the granules come in contact with the plant.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",

Tops may be clipped to 5\u2033 tall. Transplant to the garden 1\u2033 apart for bunching and 4\u2033 apart for larger bulbs.",
        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

Start seedlings as above in late spring and transplant to the garden in Summer. Sow 2-3 seeds 18\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 24\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",
        "Watering:": "Cauliflower requires consistent soil moisture. Water 1 to 1.5 inches each week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting cauliflower seeds, add compost to the soil. This prevents \u201cbuttoning,\u201d which is when a cauliflower produces smaller, button-shaped heads rather than a large, full head. For best growth, use a nitrogen-high fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "The plant should be ready to harvest about a week or two after blanching. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest heads when desired size is obtained but before the curds becomes loose and bitter. Store at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity for 2\u20133 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "When small white curds begin to develop, gather up exterior leaves and wrap around heads and tie with a rubber band, this is called blanching. Blanching will help protect heads from direct sunlight and keep curds white rather than turning pale yellow with direct sunlight."

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, work compost and an all-purpose fertilizer like a 10-10-10 variety into the top 6 inches of soil. How you fertilize turnips will depend on what you are growing them for. If you are only growing turnips for the turnip greens, use a fertilizer high in nitrogen as it encourages leafy growth. Apply a side dressing of 34-0-0 or 21-0-0 six weeks after the plant emerges. Use a more balanced fertilizer if growing for the roots.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Turnips are ready to harvest 40 to 55 days after planting. If harvesting the leaves, they are ready when they reach 4-6 inches in height.",
        "Harvesting:": "If only harvesting the leaves, cut them from the plant when they reach the desired size, leaving 1 inch of leaves above the crown of the plant. More leaves will grow in their place. If harvesting the whole plant, gently dig the turnip from the ground. If harvesting for both the root and the leaves, the turnip should be about 2 inches in diameter, but if the leaves have been harvested first, the turnip should be 3 inches in diameter when it is ready to be pulled. Pick turnips when they are smaller for a milder, sweeter flavor. Turnips with greens store at 32\u00b0F and 95% relative humidity for 10-14 days.",

        "Before Planting:": "Tomatoes should be grown in a sunny location with good soil drainage.",
        "Planting:": "Start seeds indoors under controlled conditions. Use soilless grow media. Place in a sunny window with at least 8 hours of sunlight. Water only when soil feels dry to touch. No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Irrigate regularly for best results. Broccoli does not generally do well in hot weather. The best success is with spring and fall crops.",
        "Planting:": "Use early and midseason broccoli varieties in the Spring. Sow 2 seeds per cell or 3\u20134 seeds/in. in row flats. Seedlings should be ready to transplant in 3\u20134 weeks. If possible keep soil temperature at 80\u00b0F until germination, then reduce air temperature to about 60\u00b0F. Ensure good air circulation and light. Transplant outdoors 10\u201318\u2033 apart in rows 18\u201336\u2033 apart. Broccoli prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55\u201375\u00b0F but will produce good crops under warmer, summer conditions. For a Fall crop, start seedlings indoors 3-4 weeks before transplanting. as above in May and transplant to the garden in June\u2013July. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in the Fall. Successful broccoli crops can be grown where winters are rarely below 32\u00b0F. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions. Sow 3\u20134 seeds 12\u2033 apart, \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 18\u201336\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",
        "Watering:": "Broccoli likes cool soil, so adding grass clippings around the plants helps. Also, water deeply and often. When watering broccoli, do not get water on the developing heads. Some varieties of broccoli are heat tolerant, but still require adequate watering, such as 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Broccoli is ready to harvest when florets are tightly closed in the center but begin to loosen slightly around the edges. (50-80 days)",
        "Harvesting:": "Before flower buds open, cut center head. Harvest secondary side shoots regularly to encourage continued production. If buds begin to show a yellow color, harvest immediately.",
        "Tips:": "Repel flea beetles and root maggots on young seedlings by covering with floating row covers from day of planting. Treat flea beetles with pyrethrin or azadirachtin if heavy pressure is observed. For cabbage worms and loopers, use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt.)."

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

Each variety of potato in the Standard Mix has approximately 8 potato seed pieces per pound. Usually 3-5 potatoes that can be cut into more pieces to plant. Minimum of 4lbs (1lbs of each variety).\n\t\t\tYukon Gold\n\t\t\tBest seller and an excellent keeper! Attractive, smooth, thin yellow skin, shallow eyes, yellow flesh and uniform yields. If you like your fried potatoes golden brown, Yukon Gold will almost turn that color by themselves. However, with Yukon Gold, your mashed potatoes are golden and beautiful to both the eye and the taste. When first harvested, Yukon Gold shows unique pink eyes not seen in other yellow varieties. They are best when home grown!\n\t\t\tRusset Burbank\n\t\t\tThe Idaho Potato that Idaho built its reputation on! Also known as the \"Idaho Netted Gem\" or simply \"The Russet\". It is the most widely grown potato in the United States. We have eaten literally thousands of them baked, and the last one tasted just as good as the first. Dr. Burbank even admitted he was fortunate to have bred this cultivar.\n\t\t\tRed Pontiac\n\t\t\tEasy and adaptable red potato for home gardening. Most likely the easiest and most adaptable red potato there is to grow, not to mention the consistent flavor! Attractive deep red skin and eyes, white flesh. The tuber of choice for new potatoes or fresh eating. Red Pontiac came from Florida in 1945 so it grows well in both the South and North regions.\n\t\t\tKennebec Potato Seeds\n\t\t\tOne of the most popular potatoes grown by home gardeners.\u00a0High yields of large, white skin, white fleshed tubers that grow well under harsh conditions. Kennebecs are superb boiled, mashed, fried, hashed or baked. Good jacket potato - smoother it in sour cream, cheese, chives and bacon. It's absolutely perfect.\n\t\t\tIf it is late in the season and we are out of a variety above, we will substitute the next closest variety.",

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes.

        "Before Planting:": "Lettuce is hardy and can be planted as early as the soil can be worked. It is a cool weather crop and grows best at temperatures of 60-65\u00b0F. Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, sow 1-2 weeks after last frost when soil is warm, above 70\u00b0F, 3 seeds every 18\u2033, 1/2\u2033 deep, thinning to 1 plant/spot. Space rows 6\u2032 apart. For transplanting, sow indoors in 3 weeks before last frost and transplanting outside. Plant 2-3 seeds per or pot, about 1/4\u2033 deep. Keep temperature 80-90\u00b0F until germination. Handle young plants carefully and never let the soil dry out. Grow seedlings at 75\u00b0F. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. When the weather is frost-free, warm, and settled, transplant 2-3\u2032 apart in rows 6\u2032 apart or thin to 1 plant/pot or cell with scissors and transplant 18\u2033 apart. Even hardened melon seedlings are tender. Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "Melons need a steady supply of water, and soil needs to be damped but not flooded, approximately 1 inch a week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix aged manure and compost into the soil. Melons are heavy feeders, so fertilize at planting and throughout the growing season with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. Do not let the granules come in contact with the plant.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions.

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Only treated seeds of good cold-germinating varieties may be sown in 55\u00b0F soil if warmer weather is anticipated. We recommend planting UNTREATED seeds when soil is warm, at least 65\u00b0F. Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk.

High-nitrogen fertilizers encourage leafy growth.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Gourds can take anywhere from 90 to 130 days to harvest based on the variety grown, with hard-shell varieties taking longer to mature.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest when color fully developed and stems are dry, but before hard frost. Cure out of direct sunlight at 80\u00b0F for 5-7 days. Wash fruits and dry.",

        "Planting:": "Plant cowpea seeds outdoors once the last frost date has passed. Sow them directly into the garden. Plant seeds 2 inches deep and 3 inches apart in rows set 3 feet apart. Plant the seeds with the eye of the seed facing down.",
        "Watering:": "Water frequently. When you water, try to keep from getting water on the plant\u2019s leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Cowpeas grow quicker if fertilizer is applied immediately after planting. Once the plants are established, they generally do not require frequent fertilization. However, if the plant\u2019s green leaves become pale, this means they are experiencing a nitrogen deficiency. They can then be fertilized with fish emulsion or nitrogen-rich fertilizers.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Cowpeas take 80 days or more to become ready for harvest. If growing on a vine, they will need some support like a pole or fence during their growth.",
        "Harvesting:": "Cowpea pods can get up to 6 to 10 inches in length and look similar to green beans. Pods can be harvested when they\u2019re young, as well as when they\u2019ve dried. If harvesting while green, pick the pods when they are very young. To harvest dry cowpea pods, pick after the pods have dried on the vine.",
        "Tips:": "Do not plant cowpea seeds in the same spot in the garden more than once every four years. Cowpeas grow well near corn, strawberries and cucumbers, but do not plant them near fennel or onions."

Thin bunching onions to every 1\u2033 and bulb onions to every 4\u2033.\u00a0In short-season areas, for transplanting sow seeds indoors in flats in late February to mid-March. 2-3 seeds per cell and thin when 2\u2033 tall. Tops may be clipped to 5\u2033 tall. Transplant to the garden 1\u2033 apart for bunching and 4\u2033 apart for larger bulbs.",
        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",
        "Watering:": "Corn must be well-watered due to their shallow roots. Corn requires 5 gallons of watering per square foot of crop.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilization can be done at the time of planting, as corn is meant to grow quickly, and it is a hungry plant. Fertilize the corn every 30 days. Corn doesn\u2019t prefer a certain kind of fertilizer by following the fertilizer\u2019s instructions.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When kernels are full and \u201cmilky,\u201d generally indicated by a drying and browning of the ear silks. Record the date on which about half the plants show silk. Corn is ready to eat 18-24 days after ear silks first show; the warmer the weather, the sooner you can pick it.",

        "Before Planting:": "A light, well-drained soil with a pH of 7.0 and a southern exposure is ideal. Good soil moisture is important in early stages of growth and during pollination when fruits are setting.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, sow 1-2 weeks after last frost when soil is warm, above 70\u00b0F, 3 seeds every 18\u2033, 1/2\u2033 deep, thinning to 1 plant/spot. Space rows 6\u2032 apart. For transplanting, sow indoors in 3 weeks before last frost and transplanting outside. Plant 2-3 seeds per or pot, about 1/4\u2033 deep. Keep temperature 80-90\u00b0F until germination. Handle young plants carefully and never let the soil dry out. Grow seedlings at 75\u00b0F. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. When the weather is frost-free, warm, and settled, transplant 2-3\u2032 apart in rows 6\u2032 apart or thin to 1 plant/pot or cell with scissors and transplant 18\u2033 apart. Even hardened melon seedlings are tender. Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "Melons need a steady supply of water, and soil needs to be damped but not flooded, approximately 1 inch a week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix aged manure and compost into the soil. Melons are heavy feeders, so fertilize at planting and throughout the growing season with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. Do not let the granules come in contact with the plant.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",
        "Tips:": "Cut off watering 1 week before harvest. This will give a more flavorful, concentrated melon. Over watering before harvest can cause bland taste.",

After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033.

Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes.

If pea is a vining variety its best to have a support or trellis system to help with diseases and yield. For fall crops sow 6-8 weeks before first frost date. Inoculate peas to encourage formation of nitrogen producing nodules on the plant roots. This enriches the soil, results in larger plants, and increases yield.",

Mix the compost fertilizer blend into the top 6 inches of soil. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen. Instead of fertilizing after planting the radishes, spread mulch enriched with wood ash around the plants.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Radish roots can be ready to harvest in as little as 21 days.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest promptly to avoid pithiness, beginning at about 3-4 weeks when roots are the size of a large marble. Radishes are ready to harvest when the leaves are 4 inches tall. Red radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are approximately 1 inch in diameter. White radishes are ready to harvest when the roots are \u00be inch in diameter.Wash with cool water and refrigerate.

Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

Keep temperature 80-90\u00b0F until germination. Handle young plants carefully and never let the soil dry out. Grow seedlings at 75\u00b0F. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. When the weather is frost-free, warm, and settled, transplant 2-3\u2032 apart in rows 6\u2032 apart or thin to 1 plant/pot or cell with scissors and transplant 18\u2033 apart. Even hardened melon seedlings are tender. Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "Melons need a steady supply of water, and soil needs to be damped but not flooded, approximately 1 inch a week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, mix aged manure and compost into the soil. Melons are heavy feeders, so fertilize at planting and throughout the growing season with a 5-5-5 or 10-10-10 granular fertilizer. Do not let the granules come in contact with the plant.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",

After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",

Keep soil constantly moist while germinating. For transplanting, sow 2 seeds per 2-3\u2033 container, 1\u2033 deep, 4-6 weeks before last frost date. When last frost has passed harden off transplants and sow outside. Peanuts have a long harvest to maturity and will get best results with transplanting. Space 5-8\u2033 between plants, transplant 3\u2033 deep and 18-24\u2033 between rows. Germinate at 70-80F for best results and then grow at 70F inside.",

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",
        "Tips:": "Plant lettuce near taller plants, like tomatoes, so the leaves are in the shade during the hot parts of the day."

        "Planting:": "Start seeds indoors under controlled conditions. Use soilless grow media. Place in a sunny window with at least 8 hours of sunlight. Water only when soil feels dry to touch. No fertilizer is needed until transplanting. Using a heating pad to keep the soil between 70-80\u00b0F. Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Tomatoes are ripe when they have reached the right color \u2013 red for red tomatoes, yellow for yellow tomatoes and so on \u2013 and are slightly soft when squeezed. This is usually 65 to 80 days after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

        "Before Planting:": "Pumpkins like fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 6-6.5. Row covers can protect seedlings for several weeks. Row covers should be removed when plants begin to flower. Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

        "Before Planting:": "Pumpkins like fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 6-6.5. Row covers can protect seedlings for several weeks. Row covers should be removed when plants begin to flower. Time plantings so that varieties will mature for the fall market. Planting too early can lead to dead foliage and over exposure to sun.",
        "Planting:": "Direct seeding is the easiest and most successful method of planting. Sow in late spring when soil is at least 70\u00b0F and danger of frost has passed. Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",
        "Watering:": "Water the pumpkins 1 inch per week, but don\u2019t let water get on the leaves or the fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Pumpkins are ready to harvest when the color they are supposed to become is deep and rich. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When fruit color is fully developed, clip handles close to the vine. Avoid picking up fruits by handles and take care not to damage the skin/rind. Sun cure in the field for 5-7 days. If possible store at 50-60\u00b0F with 50-70% humidity and good ventilation.",
        "Tips:": "Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora. Avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation."

        "Before Planting:": "Garlic in most cases should be planted right before your first frost date in the fall. For more Southern states that are in zones 8-10, garlic should be planted in early December. Prepare garlic for planting by breaking apart all cloves from the garlic. Be careful to leave the outer skin attached. Soak cloves in a jar of water for 2 hours prior to planting. If you have some seaweed fertilizer laying around add some of this to the water. This will help prevent fungal disease.",
        "Planting:": "Plant garlic in a rich, well drained soil that is weed-free. Dig a hole 2\u2033 deep and place soaked garlic clove in hole with the flat end facing down (pointy end up). Cover with soil and add an organic fertilizer on top. Space cloves 4-6\u2033 apart in same row and rows 18-24\u2033 apart. For best results cover soil with 6-8\u2033 of straw. In a couple months you will see shoots poking through. During the winter months growth will stop. When spring arrives growth will resume.",
        "Watering:": "Water every 3 to 5 days during bulbing.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Garlic requires adequate\u00a0nitrogen, so fertilize accordingly. Blood meal\u00a0is a good source of high-nitrogen fertilizer.\u00a0Once you begin fertilization, fertilize the\u00a0garlic every three weeks.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Garlic can take up to 210 days to mature.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest garlic when green leaves have turned brown and fallen over. Be sure to dig deep and under garlic to not break or cut the garlic itself. Upon harvesting garlic will store best with leaves braided and hung in a dark, cool cellar.",
        "Tips:": "Garlic repels pests from the garden, so it\u00a0doesn\u2019t have much trouble with them."

        "Before Planting:": "A day or two before planting, use a sharp, clean knife to slice the larger seed potatoes into two seeds. Each seed should be at least 1 1/2-2inches in size, and must contain at least 1 \u201ceye\u201d or bud. Smaller potatoes may be planted whole. Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Potatoes crave nitrogen and phosphorous. Prior to planting, non-organic gardeners can use a standard 15-15-15 fertilizer and work it into the soil\u2019s surface. To aid in potato growth, side dress freshly sprouted seeds with a mix of cottonseed meal, bone meal and green meal to increase the soil\u2019s acidity. You can also add in kelp meal. During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."
