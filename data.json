Sow seeds outdoors after last frost is expect and soil temperatures are above 70\u00b0F. Triploid (Seedless) watermelon varieties need to be grown with Diploid (Seed) watermelon varieties for fertilization. Sugar Baby is good selection for a diploid fertilizer.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, sow 1\u20132 weeks after last frost when soil is warm, above 70\u00b0F, 3 seeds every 18\u201336\u2033, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per location when seedlings have first true leaves. If transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds, 1\u2033 deep in a 2\u2033 peat pot 2-4 weeks before last frost date (no sooner!). Germinate at 80\u00b0F then reduce to a constant 75\u00b0F). Keep well watered until 1 week before placing outdoors. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. Transplant 2\u20133\u2032 apart in rows 6\u20138\u2032 apart. Even hardened watermelon seedlings are tender! Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "When they are younger, watermelon plants require lots up water, up to 2 inches per week. If your able try not to water the fruits 1 week before harvest as over-watering can cause bland fruit.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Prior to planting, amend soil with compost and a higher nitrogen fertilizer. Once vines begin to ramble, side dress plants with a 5-10-5 fertilizer and again once the melons are set.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "There are 2 good ways to tell when a watermelon is ripe: 1) the tendril nearest the point on the vine where fruit stem attaches is browning/dead. 2) the spot where the fruit rests on the ground is pale yellow. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Once a watermelon is picked, it doesn\u2019t ripen any further. To harvest, take a knife and cut",
        "Tips:": "Pruning the plant is not necessary, but it may direct more energy to growing the fruits. If you choose to prune,",
        "AVG. Direct Seeding Rate:": "1 oz./340\u2032, 1,000 seeds/500\u2032, 3 oz./1,000\u2032, 1\u2153 lb./acre at 3 seeds every 18\u2033, in rows 6\u2032 apart."

Over the next couple days the cut side of the potato will form a thick callous over the cuts, which will help to prevent it from rotting once planted.",
        "Planting:": "Potatoes may be planted as soon as the ground can be worked in the early spring, but you must use good judgment. The soil should be evenly moist, but not wet or soggy. If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep. For a 8 foot row, you will need 10 lbs; for a 25 foot row, 20 lbs; for a 50 foot row and for a 100 foot row, 40 lbs.",

During the growing season, feed the plants with fish emulsion or kelp extract every two weeks until the plants bloom. Then, six weeks after planting, side dress the potatoes with the same fertilizer mix used at planting but only half as much.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",

Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart.

Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting. Transplant should be no older than 3 weeks as stunting and damage can happen.\u00a0 Thin to 1 plant/container or cell with scissors. Harden plants 4\u20137 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out according to the spacing recommendations for each variety. Handle seedlings carefully; minimal root disturbance is best. Bush to short-vine habits generally require 6\u2032 between-row spacing, while long-vine habits generally require 10-12\u2032 between-row spacing. In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",

Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions.

        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth.

        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes.

Tops may be clipped to 5\u2033 tall. Transplant to the garden 1\u2033 apart for bunching and 4\u2033 apart for larger bulbs.",
        "Watering:": "Onions are shallow rooted and grow best with at least 1\u2033 per week of rain or irrigation, especially during the bulbing phase.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes.

For Bunching, sow about 4-6 seeds/ft., \u00bd\u201d deep, rows 18\u201324\u2033 apart. Thin to 2-3 plants per foot. Cut for bunching at any stage and new leaves will continue to form. For Salad Mix, sow every .5-1\u2033, 12-24 seeds/ft. Clip in about 4-5 weeks for tender baby greens.",
        "Watering:": "water moderately. If the plant doesn\u2019t receive enough water, it may become bitter to the taste.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Mulch with grass clippings or compost to add extra nutrients to the plants\u2019 growth.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Swiss chard grows fast, and it is usually ready to harvest four to six weeks after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Clip mature leaves individually for home garden or for bunching for market. New leaves will grow back for multiple harvests. For baby leaf, clip young plants just above the soil. Plants will grow back for multiple harvest.",
        "Tips:": "Once a leaf is cut, a new one grows in its place."

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",

        "Days to Maturity:": "Varies widely with weather conditions and planting dates. Use these figures to compare one variety to another, not to accurately predict maturity on a given day. All corn varieties will have average maturity dates available. Also can be search by early, mid and late season harvest corn varieties. (See each variety for days to maturity)",

If started the seeds indoors, sow 2 seeds 1\u2033 deep in 3\u2033+ containers 3 weeks prior to transplanting date. If growing a mixed variety, sort seeds into groups by shape and size prior to sowing. Thin to 1 plant per container/cell with scissors. Harden off plants 4-7 days prior to transplanting. After danger of frost has passed, transplant out at (small 18-24\u2033), (medium 24-36\u2033) and (large 36-48\u2033). Space rows at 6-12.

Once the gourds are established, adding fertilizer may not be necessary but for those gardeners who wish to do so, fertilize with a water-soluble, low-nitrogen fertilizer, such as 5-10-5. High-nitrogen fertilizers encourage leafy growth.",

        "Harvesting:": "Harvest fruit at desired size. Baby eggplant around 8 ounces and mini eggplant around 4 ounces. Harvesting eggplant frequently encourages more growth. To harvest, beware of the eggplant\u2019s prickly stem. The fruit bruises easily, so be gentle while harvesting. Use prunes or a sharp knife to cut the fruit from the plant, but be sure to keep a short piece of stem on the fruit.",
        "Tips:": "Harvestable fruits should be firm and inside seeds should not be visible once cut open. The inside flesh of the eggplant should be cream colored."

        "Fertilizer:": "Upon planting, add compost to the soil, but since onions are heavy feeders they will grow best if fertilized throughout their growth. Also, add a timed-release granular 10-10-10 or 12-12-12 fertilizer to spread in the soil. Using a nitrate-based fertilizer will make the onions sweeter at harvest.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Onions are ready to harvest when the green tops flop over, but they can also be harvested quite early as green onions. For the full onion, once the tops flop over, wait for a dry day to complete the harvest. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "When necks become soft and tops are falling over, pull and sun-cure at least 2-7 days, depending on weather. Move to a protected location to finish drying. When dry, clip off tops and roots and store in onion bags or shallow boxes at near freezing and 65-70% humidity.",
        "Tips:": "Onion bulbing is triggered by day length, and maximum day length during the growing season increases from south to north. Short-day onions are grown at lower latitudes in the South, while intermediate and long-day onions are grown at higher latitudes. Refer to \u201cAdaptation\u201d in each variety description for details."

If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep.

        "Days to Maturity:": "Potatoes are ready to harvest when the foliage begins to die back. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Cut the brown foliage off and leave the potatoes for 10 to 14 more days. Dig up the potatoes on a dry day but handle them gently as they bruise easily. Once harvested, store the potatoes in a cool, dark place for two weeks to allow for the skin to cure. Curing the skin allows for the potatoes to keep longer. Once cured, do not store potatoes near apples, as the apples make the potatoes go bad.",
        "Tips:": "Once plants reach 6 inches tall but before they begin to flower, gardeners should start the hilling process. This helps prevent potato sunburn, which creates a chemical called solanine that turns the potato green. Solanine is toxic, so do not eat green potatoes. This process needs to be done every few weeks throughout the potato\u2019s growing season."

Germinate at 80\u00b0F then reduce to a constant 75\u00b0F). Keep well watered until 1 week before placing outdoors. Reduce water and temperature for a week to harden seedlings. Transplant 2\u20133\u2032 apart in rows 6\u20138\u2032 apart. Even hardened watermelon seedlings are tender! Do not disturb roots when transplanting, and water thoroughly.",
        "Watering:": "When they are younger, watermelon plants require lots up water, up to 2 inches per week. If your able try not to water the fruits 1 week before harvest as over-watering can cause bland fruit.",

Careful variety selection is important for hot weather plantings. Sow every 3 weeks for a continuous supply of fresh lettuce. Lettuce seed can enter thermal dormancy when exposed to high temperatures. Do not use a heat mat when germinating lettuce seed. Optimum germination results at soil temperatures of 60\u201365\u00b0F.",
        "Planting:": "For direct seeding, seeds germinate at low soil temperatures (40\u00b0F), but poorly above 75\u00b0F. Sow seeds 2-3\u2033 apart, rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart. Cover seed lightly, about 1/8\u2033, and firm soil gently. Thin iceberg and romaine lettuce to one plant every 10\u201312\u2033, other types 8\u201310\u2033 for full size heads or 6\u2033 for mini heads. Dry soil must be watered to ensure coolness and moisture, and for uniform germination. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per cell, 1/4\u2033 deep, 3-4 weeks before transplanting outdoors. Do not let soil above 70F while germinating so keep out of sun and a cool, dark location. Harden seedlings by reducing water and temperature for 2\u20133 days before planting outdoors. Properly hardened transplants can survive temperatures as low as 20\u00b0F. Transplant iceberg and romaine lettuce 10\u201312\u2033 apart, in rows 18\u2033 apart. Other types 8\u201310\u2033 apart in rows 12\u201318\u2033 apart for full size heads or 6\u2033 apart for mini heads.",
        "Watering:": "Water lettuce once to twice per week or every 4 days whenever rainfall is inadequate.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Lettuce is typically a care-free plant, but you can fertilize the soil with an organic fertilizer one week prior to planting the seeds. Lettuce grows best in soil that is high in humus. Fertilize three weeks after transplanting seedlings with an alfalfa meal or a slow-release fertilizer.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Lettuce can be picked whenever real leaves form. Pick when the leaves are younger rather than waiting so the taste doesn\u2019t become bitter. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "For heads of lettuce, cut the plant at the soil line to harvest it. For leaf lettuces, you can harvest the entire plant or only the outer leaves as needed. Harvest in the morning. Store in cool, dark and high humidity location for up to 2-3 weeks.",

Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",

Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions.

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

Sow 2 seeds at the appropriate spacing interval for the variety\u2019s vine length, 1\u2033 deep. Thin to 1 plant per spacing interval after seedlings are established. For transplanting, sow 2-3 seeds per 2\u2033 container or plug flat about 3 weeks prior to transplanting.

In-row spacing varies depending on fruit size and is generally: small, 18-24\u2033; medium, 24-36\u2033 and large to extra-large, 36-72\u2033. Spacing requirements may vary, so check under characteristics for each variety.",

        "Fertilizer:": "Pumpkins are heavy feeders with a long growing season. Prior to planting in the garden, add compost and aged manure to the soil. Add 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer below each plant prior to sowing and mix the fertilizer into the soil. Regularly treat pumpkins with compost and manure mixed with water or feed weekly with a fish or kelp-based fertilizer. Another option for fertilizing is to use a high-nitrogen fertilizer when plants are 1 foot tall and a high-phosphorous fertilizer before the blooming period starts.",

Slowly introduce your tomato seedlings to the outdoor environment one week before transplanting. Each day add more time outside. Start with shade and no wind outdoors and work your way up gradually to sun and wind. Transplant after last frost date and soil temperature has reach 60\u00b0F.",
        "Watering:": "Water at least 1 inch per week. Always water the base of the plant and not the leaves.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Add 1 ounce of high phosphorus fertilizer (5-10-10) in hole before transplanting. Fertilize again when first tomatoes begin to appear and then again when first tomato is picked.",

        "Harvesting:": "Fully vine-ripen fruit only for local retailing or use. To deliver sound fruit, pick fruit less ripe the further the distance and the longer the time between the field and the customer. Store firm, ripe fruit 45-60\u00b0F for 4-7 days. Some varieties will store longer.",
        "Tips:": "Learn the common tomato diseases in your area. Select resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

        "Days to Maturity:": "A ripe melon should be very easy to remove from the vine. For a cantaloupe, the netting pattern on the melon becomes more visible and a crack appears at the base of the stem when it was ripe. For a honeydew, the color becomes creamy. Most melon varieties are ready for harvest when the gray-green color begins to change to pale yellow and when a light tug separates the fruit from the vine. Some melon types, like honeydew, Charentais, canary, Spanish, and Crenshaw are overripe by the time the stem can be tugged from the fruit. (See each variety for days to maturity)",
        "Harvesting:": "Melons must be cut from the vine.\u00a0 All melons should be stored at 90% relative humidity. Store ripe melons at 40-45\u00b0F for 7-14 days.",

        "Planting:": "Plant the seeds 1/4 inch deep, water after planting and cover loosely with plastic to retain moisture. Transplant the seedlings to the garden when soil temperatures reach 60 degrees. Leave up to 24 inches between plants in rows set 2 to 3 feet apart.",
        "Watering:": "Water 1 to 2 inches per week.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Fertilize with a complete nutrient solution to keep plants dark green and healthy.",
        "Days to Maturity:": "Eggplants are ready to harvest as soon as 70 days after sowing the seeds.",
        "Harvesting:": "Harvest fruit at desired size. Baby eggplant around 8 ounces and mini eggplant around 4 ounces. Harvesting eggplant frequently encourages more growth. To harvest, beware of the eggplant\u2019s prickly stem. The fruit bruises easily, so be gentle while harvesting. Use prunes or a sharp knife to cut the fruit from the plant, but be sure to keep a short piece of stem on the fruit.",
        "Tips:": "Harvestable fruits should be firm and inside seeds should not be visible once cut open. The inside flesh of the eggplant should be cream colored."

For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, plow in tomato plant refuse in the fall, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent Blossom End Rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture. Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis. Use spinosad for potato beetle larvae and adults."

If the soil is water logged when you dig, not only will you risk \u201ccaking\u201d the soil, your seed potatoes will probably rot before they even get started. Assume that you get on average 4 potato seeds per pound of potatoes. If you plant a seed potato, plant with the eye facing up in a trench dug 4 inches deep.

Floating row covers may be used on early plantings to help moderate soil temperature. Each corn variety will state if it is TREATED or UNTREATED in the characteristics tab.\u00a0Keep Super Sweets corn varieties a minimum of 300 feet from non-Super Sweet varieties. Sow 3/4-1\u2033 deep, 6-7\u2033 apart (treated) & 4-5\u2033 (untreated), rows 30-36\u2033 apart. Arrange in blocks of at least 4 rows for proper pollination, which is needed for well-filled ears. Successive plantings can be made through early summer; most growers prefer to extend the sweet corn season by planting a few varieties of different maturities. Once corn reaches to be 4 inches tall, thin out to 8-12 inches apart.",

        "Before Planting:": "Cabbage require fertile soils in a pH range of 6.5-7.5, supplied with consistent irrigation throughout the growing period.",
        "Planting:": "Use early and midseason varieties for Spring crop. Sow 2 seeds per cell 1/4\u2033 deep. Seedlings should be ready to transplant in 4-6 weeks. If possible keep soil temperature over 75\u00b0F until germination, then reduce air temperature to about 60\u00b0F. Transplant outdoors, 12-18\u2033 apart in rows 18-36\u2033 apart. Cabbage prefers cooler growing temperatures, between 55-75\u00b0F, but will produce decent crops under warmer, summer conditions. Use midseason and storage varieties for Fall crop. Start seedlings late spring and transplant to the garden in early summer. To ensure mature heads, seed the crop early in areas where heavy freezes occur early in fall. Successful cabbage crops can be grown where winters are mild. Transplants can be set out from September to February in these regions. Sow 3-4 seeds 12\u2033 apart, 1/2\u2033 deep, rows 24-36\u2033 apart, thinning to one plant in each group.",
        "Watering:": "Be sure to water evenly, as uneven water can split the heads. Cut back on watering as cabbage reaches maturity, as this also can split the heads.",
        "Fertilizer:": "Cabbage requires heavy fertilization. Fertilize plants with a high-nitrogen fertilizer",
        "Days to Maturity:": "See each variety for maturity rate from transplanting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Relatively young heads (still green and actively growing) store best. Ideal conditions are 32\u00b0F at 95% relative humidity, with good air circulation.",
        "Tips:": "Cabbage plants do better when planted near herbs like dill and rosemary. Avoid planting cabbage near strawberries, tomatoes or pole beans."

        "Days to Maturity:": "Swiss chard grows fast, and it is usually ready to harvest four to six weeks after planting.",
        "Harvesting:": "Clip mature leaves individually for home garden or for bunching for market. New leaves will grow back for multiple harvests. For baby leaf, clip young plants just above the soil. Plants will grow back for multiple harvest.",
